# Simple RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Project

This project demonstrates a **simple implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** using Python and popular libraries such as `langchain`, `Chroma`.

## 🔍 What is RAG?

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a method that enhances the performance of language models by retrieving relevant context from a knowledge base or document store and feeding it into a generative model to provide accurate and contextually aware answers.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Document Ingestion**: Load and chunk your documents.
2. **Embedding Generation**: Convert chunks into vector representations using pre-trained embeddings.
3. **Vector Store (Chroma)**: Store the embeddings in a Chroma index for fast retrieval.
4. **Query Handling**: When a user asks a question, retrieve the most relevant chunks using similarity search.
5. **Answer Generation**: Feed the retrieved context and the question into a generative language model like OpenAI or HuggingFace Transformers to get an answer.

## 🛠️ Steps to Reproduce

1. **Clone the repository or open the Colab link**.
2. **Upload your documents** (can be PDF, text files, etc.).
3. Follow the steps in the notebook:
   - ✅ Load and preprocess the document.
   - 🧱 Split the document into smaller, manageable chunks.
   - 📐 Generate embeddings using OpenAI Embeddings or another embedding model.
   - 🧠 Store the embeddings in a Chroma vector store.
   - 🔍 Use similarity search to retrieve the most relevant chunks based on user queries.
   - ✨ Pass the relevant context and user question into a generative language model to generate an accurate response.
